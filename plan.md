- [x] RCP-1: `run_role_wizard` gains a backup-chain question

  ## Global Constraints

  - No new runtime dependency.
  - The simple 2-agent draft flow (`planner.py`) is untouched in behavior -- Task 2's refactor must not change any of its existing tests' outcomes.
  - No cross-invocation resume/checkpointing is added for the brainstorm-to-plan flow -- a crash mid-flow means starting the "brainstorm" choice over.
  - The backup-chain wizard question is never validated inline -- a bad agent name surfaces later at the existing `doctor` gate, matching how implementer/tester/reviewer already behave.
  - `generate_plan_from_synthesis`'s retry budget is exactly 2 total attempts; an agent-availability failure (`AgentMissing`/`AgentTimeout`/`AgentUnavailable`) is never treated as a retry-worthy parse failure -- it propagates immediately.
  - Every existing test in this repo must still pass after every task, except the ones this plan explicitly rewrites because the wizard's own answer sequence gained a new question.

  **Note on this pairing:** Grok implements, Codex reviews.

  **Files:**
  - Modify: `src/whyline_relay/setup.py`
  - Test: `tests/test_setup.py`

  **Interfaces:**
  - Produces: `run_role_wizard(...)` now returns `{"implementer": ..., "tester": ..., "reviewer": ..., "backup": <comma-joined string, "" if none>}`. Writes `[backup]\nchain = [...]\n` appended to config.toml only when the answer is non-empty.

  Step 1: Write the failing tests

  First, fix every *existing* test in `tests/test_setup.py` that supplies a
  fixed `answers` sequence to `run_role_wizard` or `setup.run` -- each now
  needs one more answer for the new backup question, inserted right after
  the reviewer answer:

  1. `test_run_role_wizard_writes_config_and_test_prompt`: change
     `answers = iter(["grok", "codex", ""])` to
     `answers = iter(["grok", "codex", "", ""])` (blank reviewer default,
     blank backup), and change the assertion to
     `assert result == {"implementer": "grok", "tester": "codex", "reviewer": "claude", "backup": ""}`.
  2. `test_run_role_wizard_config_parses_as_a_valid_pipeline`: change
     `answers = iter(["codex", "claude", "claude"])` to
     `answers = iter(["codex", "claude", "claude", ""])`.
  3. `test_run_commits_setup_before_running_doctor`: change
     `answers = iter(["existing", "codex", "claude", "claude", "n"])` to
     `answers = iter(["existing", "codex", "claude", "claude", "", "n"])`.
  4. `test_run_refuses_to_offer_start_on_a_fail`: change
     `answers = iter(["existing", "codex", "claude", "claude"])` to
     `answers = iter(["existing", "codex", "claude", "claude", ""])`.
  5. `test_run_asks_before_proceeding_on_a_warn_and_honors_no`: change
     `answers = iter(["existing", "codex", "claude", "claude", "n"])` to
     `answers = iter(["existing", "codex", "claude", "claude", "", "n"])`.
  6. `test_run_execs_into_start_when_clean_and_confirmed`: change
     `answers = iter(["existing", "codex", "claude", "claude", ""])` (the
     trailing `""` was for "start now [Y]") to
     `answers = iter(["existing", "codex", "claude", "claude", "", ""])` (now
     two trailing blanks: backup, then start-confirm).

  Then add new tests:

  ```python
  def test_run_role_wizard_backup_chain_writes_backup_table(tmp_path: Path):
      answers = iter(["codex", "claude", "claude", "aider, backup2"])
      result = setup.run_role_wizard(
          tmp_path,
          input_fn=lambda prompt="": next(answers),
          print_fn=lambda *a, **k: None,
      )
      assert result["backup"] == "aider, backup2"
      config_text = (tmp_path / ".whyline" / "relay" / "config.toml").read_text()
      assert "[backup]" in config_text
      assert 'chain = ["aider", "backup2"]' in config_text


  def test_run_role_wizard_blank_backup_writes_no_backup_table(tmp_path: Path):
      answers = iter(["codex", "claude", "claude", ""])
      result = setup.run_role_wizard(
          tmp_path,
          input_fn=lambda prompt="": next(answers),
          print_fn=lambda *a, **k: None,
      )
      assert result["backup"] == ""
      config_text = (tmp_path / ".whyline" / "relay" / "config.toml").read_text()
      assert "[backup]" not in config_text


  def test_run_role_wizard_backup_chain_config_loads_correctly(tmp_path: Path):
      answers = iter(["codex", "claude", "claude", "claude"])
      setup.run_role_wizard(
          tmp_path,
          input_fn=lambda prompt="": next(answers),
          print_fn=lambda *a, **k: None,
      )
      loaded = config.load(tmp_path)
      assert loaded.backup_chain == ["claude"]
  ```

  Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail

  Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_setup.py -v`
  Expected: FAIL on every test touching `run_role_wizard` (`StopIteration` from the now-too-short answer iterators, or the three new tests not yet passing).

  Step 3: Implement

  In `src/whyline_relay/setup.py`, replace `run_role_wizard`:

  ```python
  def run_role_wizard(root: Path, *, input_fn=None, print_fn=None) -> dict[str, str]:
      """Asks implementer/tester/reviewer/backup, writes config.toml and
      prompts/test.md. Returns the chosen agent names, "backup" as a
      comma-joined string ("" if none was given)."""
      input_fn = input_fn if input_fn is not None else input
      print_fn = print_fn if print_fn is not None else print

      implementer = input_fn("Who implements? [codex]: ").strip() or "codex"
      tester = input_fn("Who tests?      [claude]: ").strip() or "claude"
      reviewer = input_fn("Who reviews?    [claude]: ").strip() or "claude"
      backup_raw = input_fn(
          "Backup chain (comma-separated, blank for none): "
      ).strip()
      backup_chain = [name.strip() for name in backup_raw.split(",") if name.strip()]

      relay = config.relay_dir(root)
      config_path = relay / "config.toml"
      config_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
      content = PIPELINE_CONFIG_TEMPLATE.format(
          implementer=implementer, tester=tester, reviewer=reviewer
      )
      if backup_chain:
          chain_toml = ", ".join(f'"{name}"' for name in backup_chain)
          content += f"\n[backup]\nchain = [{chain_toml}]\n"
      config_path.write_text(content, encoding="utf-8")
      print_fn(f"Wrote {config_path.relative_to(root)}.")

      test_prompt_path = relay / "prompts" / "test.md"
      test_prompt_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
      test_prompt_path.write_text(TEST_PROMPT_TEMPLATE, encoding="utf-8")
      print_fn(f"Wrote {test_prompt_path.relative_to(root)}.")

      return {
          "implementer": implementer,
          "tester": tester,
          "reviewer": reviewer,
          "backup": ", ".join(backup_chain),
      }
  ```

  Step 4: Run the tests to verify they pass

  Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_setup.py -v`
  Expected: PASS

  Step 5: Run the whole suite

  Run: `uv run pytest -q`
  Expected: PASS

  Step 6: Commit

  ```bash
  git add src/whyline_relay/setup.py tests/test_setup.py
  git commit -m "feat: role wizard asks for a backup chain"
  ```

- [x] RCP-2: Generalize the human gate into `planner.review_gate`

  ## Global Constraints

  - No new runtime dependency.
  - The simple 2-agent draft flow (`planner.py`) is untouched in behavior -- Task 2's refactor must not change any of its existing tests' outcomes.
  - No cross-invocation resume/checkpointing is added for the brainstorm-to-plan flow -- a crash mid-flow means starting the "brainstorm" choice over.
  - The backup-chain wizard question is never validated inline -- a bad agent name surfaces later at the existing `doctor` gate, matching how implementer/tester/reviewer already behave.
  - `generate_plan_from_synthesis`'s retry budget is exactly 2 total attempts; an agent-availability failure (`AgentMissing`/`AgentTimeout`/`AgentUnavailable`) is never treated as a retry-worthy parse failure -- it propagates immediately.
  - Every existing test in this repo must still pass after every task, except the ones this plan explicitly rewrites because the wizard's own answer sequence gained a new question.

  **Note on this pairing:** Grok implements, Codex reviews.

  **Files:**
  - Modify: `src/whyline_relay/planner.py`
  - Test: `tests/test_planner.py`

  **Interfaces:**
  - Produces: `review_gate(root, settings, draft_path, description, *, drafted_by, revise_fn, on_settled=lambda: None, confirm=input, echo=True, runner=subprocess.run) -> str` -- a new, public function. `revise_fn: Callable[[str], None]` is called with the human's typed feedback and is responsible for regenerating whatever's at `draft_path`. `on_settled: Callable[[], None]` is called once, right after a discard or right after a successful approve-write, for a caller with its own session state to clear (the simple planner clears its checkpoint here; the new brainstorm flow has none, so it stays the default no-op).
  - Consumes: nothing new from Task 1.

  Step 1: Write the failing tests

  Read `tests/test_planner.py` in full first (392 lines) -- it already has
  five tests exercising `_human_gate`'s approve/revise/discard behavior
  through `planner.start`/`resume` (their names:
  `test_discarding_clears_the_checkpoint_and_keeps_the_draft_file`,
  `test_requesting_changes_redrafts_before_the_gate_reappears`, and others
  around lines 260-364). **None of these need to change** -- this task is a
  pure refactor, and they must all still pass unchanged afterward, proving
  `_human_gate`'s externally-visible behavior (via `planner.start`/`resume`)
  is identical.

  Add new tests exercising `review_gate` directly, at the bottom of the file:

  ```python
  def test_review_gate_approve_writes_and_commits(tmp_path: Path):
      from whyline_relay import gitcheck

      subprocess.run(["git", "init", "-q"], cwd=tmp_path, check=True)
      subprocess.run(["git", "config", "user.email", "t@t"], cwd=tmp_path, check=True)
      subprocess.run(["git", "config", "user.name", "t"], cwd=tmp_path, check=True)
      (tmp_path / "README.md").write_text("x\n")
      subprocess.run(["git", "add", "-A"], cwd=tmp_path, check=True)
      subprocess.run(["git", "commit", "-qm", "init"], cwd=tmp_path, check=True)

      settings = settings_with_planner(tmp_path)

      log = subprocess.run(
          ["git", "log", "-1", "--format=%s"], cwd=tmp_path,
          capture_output=True, text=True,

      settings = settings_with_planner(tmp_path)
      draft = tmp_path / ".whyline" / "relay" / "some-draft.md"
      draft.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
      draft.write_text("- [ ] T-1: round 1\n  y.\n")
      received = []

      def revise(feedback: str) -> None:
          received.append(feedback)
          draft.write_text("- [ ] T-1: round 2\n  y.\n")

      result = planner.review_gate(
          tmp_path, settings, draft, "a plan",
          drafted_by="test-agent", revise_fn=revise,
          confirm=_confirm(["r", "make it shorter", "a", "n"]),
      )
      assert received == ["make it shorter"]
      assert "round 2" in (tmp_path / settings.plan).read_text()


  def test_review_gate_discard_calls_on_settled_and_keeps_the_draft(tmp_path: Path):
      settings = settings_with_planner(tmp_path)
      draft = tmp_path / ".whyline" / "relay" / "some-draft.md"
      draft.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
      draft.write_text("- [ ] T-1: x\n  y.\n")
      settled = []

      result = planner.review_gate(
          tmp_path, settings, draft, "a plan",
          drafted_by="test-agent",
          revise_fn=lambda feedback: (_ for _ in ()).throw(
              AssertionError("must not be called on discard")
          ),
          on_settled=lambda: settled.append(True),
          confirm=_confirm(["d"]),
      )
      assert "Discarded" in result
      assert settled == [True]
      assert draft.exists()
      assert not (tmp_path / settings.plan).exists()
  ```

  Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail

  Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_planner.py -v`
  Expected: FAIL on the three new `review_gate` tests
  (`AttributeError: module 'planner' has no attribute 'review_gate'`); the
  five pre-existing gate-related tests still pass (nothing has changed yet).

  Step 3: Implement

  In `src/whyline_relay/planner.py`, replace `_human_gate` with a new public
  `review_gate` plus a thin wrapper preserving the old name and exact
  behavior for this module's own two call sites (`start`, `resume`):

  ```python
  def review_gate(
      root: Path,
      settings: config.Config,
      draft_path: Path,

  ) -> str:
      """The shared three-way human approval gate for any drafted plan.md.

      `revise_fn(feedback)` is called on "request changes" and must leave a
      revised draft at `draft_path` when it returns -- the gate then re-reads
      it and asks again. `on_settled()` is called once, right after a discard
      or right after a successful approve-write, so a caller with its own
      session state (the simple planner's checkpoint; a future caller's own

- [x] RCP-3: `brainstorm.py` -- `generate_plan_from_synthesis`

  ## Global Constraints

  - No new runtime dependency.
  - The simple 2-agent draft flow (`planner.py`) is untouched in behavior -- Task 2's refactor must not change any of its existing tests' outcomes.
  - No cross-invocation resume/checkpointing is added for the brainstorm-to-plan flow -- a crash mid-flow means starting the "brainstorm" choice over.
  - The backup-chain wizard question is never validated inline -- a bad agent name surfaces later at the existing `doctor` gate, matching how implementer/tester/reviewer already behave.
  - `generate_plan_from_synthesis`'s retry budget is exactly 2 total attempts; an agent-availability failure (`AgentMissing`/`AgentTimeout`/`AgentUnavailable`) is never treated as a retry-worthy parse failure -- it propagates immediately.
  - Every existing test in this repo must still pass after every task, except the ones this plan explicitly rewrites because the wizard's own answer sequence gained a new question.

  **Note on this pairing:** Grok implements, Codex reviews.

  **Files:**
  - Modify: `src/whyline_relay/brainstorm.py`
  - Test: `tests/test_brainstorm_plan.py` (new file)

  **Interfaces:**
  - Consumes: `chat.run_turn` (unchanged), `plan.parse`/`plan.PlanError` (unchanged).
  - Produces: `brainstorm.plan_draft_path(root) -> Path`. `brainstorm.NothingToSynthesize(RuntimeError)`. `generate_plan_from_synthesis(root, settings, final_agent, models, topic, *, feedback=None, run_fn=None, runner=None, max_attempts=2) -> Path` -- returns the validated draft's path on success; raises `NothingToSynthesize` if the shared doc is empty/missing (RCP6), or the last `plan.PlanError` if still invalid after `max_attempts`; `agents.AgentMissing`/`AgentTimeout`/`chat.AgentUnavailable` propagate immediately, uncaught, unretried.

  Step 1: Write the failing tests

  Create `tests/test_brainstorm_plan.py`:

- [ ] RCP-4: Wire "brainstorm" into `choose_plan_source`, end to end

  ## Global Constraints

  - No new runtime dependency.
  - The simple 2-agent draft flow (`planner.py`) is untouched in behavior -- Task 2's refactor must not change any of its existing tests' outcomes.
  - No cross-invocation resume/checkpointing is added for the brainstorm-to-plan flow -- a crash mid-flow means starting the "brainstorm" choice over.
  - The backup-chain wizard question is never validated inline -- a bad agent name surfaces later at the existing `doctor` gate, matching how implementer/tester/reviewer already behave.
  - `generate_plan_from_synthesis`'s retry budget is exactly 2 total attempts; an agent-availability failure (`AgentMissing`/`AgentTimeout`/`AgentUnavailable`) is never treated as a retry-worthy parse failure -- it propagates immediately.
  - Every existing test in this repo must still pass after every task, except the ones this plan explicitly rewrites because the wizard's own answer sequence gained a new question.

  **Note on this pairing:** Grok implements, Codex reviews.

  **Files:**
  - Modify: `src/whyline_relay/setup.py`
  - Test: `tests/test_setup.py`

  **Interfaces:**
  - Consumes: `brainstorm.ask_brainstorm_setup`/`run_pass_zero`/`merge_pass_zero`/`run_review_pass`/`run_final_synthesis`/`generate_plan_from_synthesis`/`NothingToSynthesize` (Task 3), `planner.review_gate` (Task 2).
  - Produces: `choose_plan_source(...)` accepts `"brainstorm"` as a third choice; a new `_run_brainstorm_plan_source(root, settings, *, input_fn, print_fn, run_fn=None, runner=None, confirm=None) -> bool` implements it.

  Step 1: Write the failing tests

  Add to `tests/test_setup.py`:

  ```python
  def _init_git_repo(root: Path) -> None:
      subprocess.run(["git", "init", "-q"], cwd=root, check=True)
      subprocess.run(["git", "config", "user.email", "t@t"], cwd=root, check=True)
      subprocess.run(["git", "config", "user.name", "t"], cwd=root, check=True)
      (root / "README.md").write_text("x\n")
      subprocess.run(["git", "add", "-A"], cwd=root, check=True)
      subprocess.run(["git", "commit", "-qm", "init"], cwd=root, check=True)


  def test_choose_plan_source_brainstorm_end_to_end_writes_a_real_plan(tmp_path: Path):
      _init_git_repo(tmp_path)
      settings = config.load(tmp_path)

      def fake_run_fn(command, prompt, **kwargs):
          from whyline_relay.agents import RunResult
          from whyline_relay import brainstorm

          if "Research" in prompt:
              brainstorm.temp_path(tmp_path, "claude").parent.mkdir(
                  parents=True, exist_ok=True
              )
              brainstorm.temp_path(tmp_path, "claude").write_text("some findings\n")
          elif "checkbox format" in prompt:
              brainstorm.plan_draft_path(tmp_path).write_text(
                  "- [ ] T-1: build it\n  as synthesized.\n"
              )
          elif "Final Synthesis" in prompt:
              pass  # the final-synthesis turn itself needs no file write here
          return RunResult(0, '{"type":"result","result":"ok"}\n')

      answers = iter([
          "brainstorm",   # choose_plan_source's own choice
          "build a widget",  # topic
          "1",            # models: claude only
          "0",            # passes: 0 (straight to synthesis)
          "",             # final model: default (claude)
          "a",            # review_gate: approve
          "n",            # don't start now
      ])
      result = setup.choose_plan_source(
          tmp_path, settings,
          input_fn=lambda prompt="": next(answers),
          print_fn=lambda *a, **k: None,
          run_fn=fake_run_fn,
      )
      assert result is True
      written = (tmp_path / settings.plan).read_text(encoding="utf-8")
      assert "build it" in written
      from whyline_relay import plan
      assert len(plan.parse(written)) == 1


  def test_choose_plan_source_brainstorm_declined_at_availability_check(tmp_path: Path):

      answers = iter([
          "brainstorm", "build a widget", "4", "0", "", "n",  # "4" = grok, unavailable here; "n" declines
      ])
      result = setup.choose_plan_source(
          tmp_path, settings,
          input_fn=lambda prompt="": next(answers),
          print_fn=lambda *a, **k: None,
      )
      assert result is False


  def test_choose_plan_source_brainstorm_nothing_to_synthesize_is_reported(
      tmp_path: Path, capsys
  ):
      _init_git_repo(tmp_path)
      settings = config.load(tmp_path)

      def fake_run_fn(command, prompt, **kwargs):
          from whyline_relay.agents import RunResult
          # Every phase runs but never writes any temp/shared content, so the
          # shared doc ends up empty -- simulates every model failing pass-0.
          return RunResult(0, '{"type":"result","result":"ok"}\n')

      printed = []
      answers = iter(["brainstorm", "build a widget", "1", "0", ""])
      result = setup.choose_plan_source(
          tmp_path, settings,
          input_fn=lambda prompt="": next(answers),
          print_fn=lambda *a, **k: printed.append(" ".join(str(x) for x in a)),
          run_fn=fake_run_fn,
      )
      assert result is False
      assert any("nothing to turn into a plan" in line for line in printed)
  ```

  Check `brainstorm.ask_brainstorm_setup`'s exact prompt wording (read it in
  `src/whyline_relay/brainstorm.py` before trusting the answer sequences
  above verbatim) -- the model-selection menu text, pass-count prompt, and
  final-model prompt must match what these fake answers are actually
  responding to.

  Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail

  Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_setup.py -k brainstorm -v`
  Expected: FAIL (`choose_plan_source` doesn't accept `run_fn` yet, and has
  no "brainstorm" branch).

  Step 3: Implement

  In `src/whyline_relay/setup.py`, add the necessary imports at the top:
  `from whyline_relay import agents, brainstorm, chat, plan` (alongside the
  existing `from whyline_relay import config, gitcheck, planner, preflight`).

  Add a new function:

  ```python
  def _run_brainstorm_plan_source(
      root: Path,
      settings: "config.Config",
      *,
      input_fn=None,
      print_fn=None,
      run_fn=None,
      runner=None,
      confirm=None,
  ) -> bool:
      """The "brainstorm" choice: runs the existing brainstorm engine
      unchanged, then turns its final synthesis into a real plan.md via the
      shared review gate (RCP1)."""
      input_fn = input_fn if input_fn is not None else input
      print_fn = print_fn if print_fn is not None else print
      confirm = confirm if confirm is not None else input

      setup_answers = brainstorm.ask_brainstorm_setup(
          root, settings, input_fn=input_fn, print_fn=print_fn
      )
      if setup_answers is None:
          return (root / settings.plan).exists()

      topic = setup_answers["topic"]
      models = setup_answers["models"]
      passes = setup_answers["passes"]
      final_agent = setup_answers["final_agent"]
      kwargs = {"run_fn": run_fn} if run_fn is not None else {}
      if runner is not None:
          kwargs["runner"] = runner

      actual_agents = brainstorm.run_pass_zero(
          root, models, topic, settings=settings, print_fn=print_fn, **kwargs
      )
      brainstorm.merge_pass_zero(root, models, topic, actual_agents=actual_agents)
      for pass_number in range(1, passes + 1):
          actual_agents = brainstorm.run_review_pass(
              root, models, topic, pass_number, settings=settings,
              print_fn=print_fn, actual_agents=actual_agents, **kwargs,
          )
      brainstorm.run_final_synthesis(
          root, final_agent, models, topic, settings=settings, **kwargs
      )

      try:
          draft = brainstorm.generate_plan_from_synthesis(
              root, settings, final_agent, models, topic, **kwargs
          )
      except brainstorm.NothingToSynthesize as error:
          print_fn(str(error))
          return (root / settings.plan).exists()
      except (agents.AgentMissing, agents.AgentTimeout, chat.AgentUnavailable) as error:
          print_fn(f"Could not generate a plan from the synthesis: {error}")
          return (root / settings.plan).exists()
      except plan.PlanError as error:
          print_fn(
              f"The drafted plan still did not parse after retrying: {error}. "
              f"Left at {brainstorm.plan_draft_path(root)} for you to fix by hand."
          )
          return (root / settings.plan).exists()

      def revise(feedback: str) -> None:
          brainstorm.generate_plan_from_synthesis(
              root, settings, final_agent, models, topic, feedback=feedback, **kwargs
          )

      result = planner.review_gate(
          root, settings, draft, topic,
          drafted_by=f"brainstorm ({final_agent})",
          revise_fn=revise,
          confirm=confirm,
      )
      print_fn(result)
      return (root / settings.plan).exists()
  ```

  Now update `choose_plan_source` itself: add `run_fn=None, runner=None,
  confirm=None` to its parameter list, and add a third branch. Find:

  ```python
      if choice == "draft":
          description = input_fn("What should this plan build? ").strip()
          if not description:
              print_fn("No description given -- nothing drafted.")
              return plan_path.exists()
          try:
              summary = planner_start(root, settings, description)
          except planner.PlanAlreadyInProgress as error:
              print_fn(str(error))
              return plan_path.exists()
          print_fn(summary)
          return plan_path.exists()

      if not plan_path.exists():
  ```

  and insert a new branch right after the `if choice == "draft":` block,
  before `if not plan_path.exists():`:

  ```python
      if choice == "brainstorm":
          return _run_brainstorm_plan_source(
              root, settings, input_fn=input_fn, print_fn=print_fn,
              run_fn=run_fn, runner=runner, confirm=confirm,
          )

      if not plan_path.exists():
  ```

  Also update the prompt text and its default-choice logic slightly higher
  up in the same function -- find:

  ```python
      choice = (
          input_fn(
              f"Use the existing {settings.plan}, or draft a new one? "
              f"[{default_choice}]: "
          ).strip().lower()
          or default_choice
      )
  ```

  and change the prompt wording only (the default-choice logic itself is
  unchanged -- brainstorm is never the default):

  ```python
      choice = (
          input_fn(
              f"Use the existing {settings.plan}, draft a new one, or "
              f"brainstorm one? [{default_choice}]: "
          ).strip().lower()
          or default_choice
      )
  ```

  Step 4: Run the tests to verify they pass

  Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_setup.py -v`
  Expected: PASS (every test in the file, old and new)

  Step 5: Run the whole suite

  Run: `uv run pytest -q`
  Expected: PASS

  Step 6: Commit

  ```bash
  git add src/whyline_relay/setup.py tests/test_setup.py
  git commit -m "feat: wire brainstorming into choose_plan_source as a third option"
  ```
