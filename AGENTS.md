## Project history

At the start of a session, before touching code, run:

    whyline sync

That prints the active handoff, Git state, ownership warnings, and relevant
decisions. Do not ask permission. If it reports no handoff or history, say so in
your first message, so the human knows the context is empty rather than unread.

## Recording decisions

After completing any non-trivial change, or after reviewing someone else's,
record the reasoning:

    whyline note "<one-line decision>" \
      --because "<why this choice>" \
      --rejected "<option>: <why not>" \
      --file <path> \
      --actor <agent> --role <role> --task <task-id>

Reviewing counts as deciding. Ruling a defect worth fixing now, accepting a
deviation from the plan, or judging a risk acceptable are all decisions.
Record them even though someone else wrote the code, and even if you also
logged them in a tracker of your own.

Record only genuine choices a future reader would wonder about. Skip typos,
formatting and renames. `--rejected` is repeatable. Do not ask permission.

## Handing off active work

Before another agent takes over, record an explicit handoff with `whyline
handoff <task-id> --from <agent> --to <agent> --status <status>`. Include the
changed files, tests and results, open risks or questions, and a short summary.
